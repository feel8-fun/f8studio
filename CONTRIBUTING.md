# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Licensing model

This repository uses dual licensing:

- Open-source distribution under `AGPL-3.0-only`
- Separate commercial licensing offered by the project owner

Public project owner identity: `Feel8.Fun`
Legal entity details are provided in commercial agreements.

## Contributor agreement required (CLA)

To keep dual licensing possible, all non-trivial contributions must be covered by a signed CLA.

- Individuals sign: `cla/ICLA.md`
- Company/organization contributions sign: `cla/CCLA.md`

No code contribution will be merged until the required CLA is signed and recorded by maintainers.
