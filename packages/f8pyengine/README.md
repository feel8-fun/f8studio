## f8pyengine

Python engine-side runtime service (`serviceClass=f8.pyengine`).

Entry wiring lives in `f8pyengine/pyengine_service.py` and is exposed via `f8pyengine/main.py`:
- `python -m f8pyengine.main --describe`
- `python -m f8pyengine.main --service-id engine1 --nats-url nats://127.0.0.1:4222`

### Lovense mock input

`Lovense Mock Server` (`operatorClass=f8.lovense_mock_server`) starts an in-process HTTP server (`POST /command`) compatible with Lovense Local API "Mobile" mode, and publishes each received command to the runtime-owned `event` state field (no exec flow required).
