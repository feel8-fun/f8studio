## Service State Fields

| Name | Access | Required | On Node | Schema | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tempoWindowSec` | `rw` | `false` | `true` | `number / default=8.0` | Window length in seconds for tempo estimation. |
| `pulseWindowSec` | `rw` | `false` | `true` | `number / default=6.0` | Window length in seconds for pulse clarity. |
| `emitEvery` | `rw` | `false` | `true` | `integer / default=1` | Emit one rhythmFeatures payload every N coreFeatures inputs. |
| `lastError` | `ro` | `false` | `false` | `string / default=` | Last runtime error string. |
| `active` | `rw` | `false` | `true` | `boolean / default=True` | Service lifecycle state (activate/deactivate). |
| `svcId` | `ro` | `false` | `false` | `string` | Readonly: current service instance id (svcId). |

## Service Data Input Ports

| Name | Required | On Node | Schema | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `coreFeatures` | `true` | `true` | `any` | Input core feature payload from f8.audiofeat.core. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rhythmFeatures` | `true` | `true` | `any` | Rhythm feature payload. |

## Usage Guide (Manual)

### Recommended Use Cases

- Derive tempo and pulse clarity from `coreFeatures` output.
- Build rungraph controls synced with music beat intensity.

### Minimal Run Example

```bash
pixi run f8pyaudiofeat_rhythm --service-id audiofeat_rhythm
```

### Common Pitfalls

- No incoming `coreFeatures` edge means rhythm node stays idle.
- Too-short `tempoWindowSec` may produce unstable BPM estimates.

### Troubleshooting

- Verify rungraph edge: `f8.audiofeat.core/coreFeatures -> f8.audiofeat.rhythm/coreFeatures`.
- Increase `tempoWindowSec` when BPM jumps too frequently.
